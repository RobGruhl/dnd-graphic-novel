# PART 1: GETTING STARTED

## Welcome, New DM!

This guide contains everything you need to run a fun D&D session for the Player. Don't worry about knowing all the rules perfectly - the goal is to have fun telling a story together.

### What You'll Need
- This guide (printed or on a screen)
- A set of dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20) or a dice app
- Pencil and paper for notes
- About 90 minutes of uninterrupted time

### The Golden Rules
1. **Say "yes" to creative ideas** - If the Player tries something clever, let it work!
2. **Keep things moving** - If you're unsure about a rule, make a quick decision and move on
3. **The dice don't always decide** - You can adjust results to keep the story fun
4. **It's okay to not know** - Make it up! You're the DM, your word is law

---

## How to Play Two Characters

the Player has two characters: **Lightsword** (the lizardfolk wizard) and **Spore** (the mushroom rogue). Here are your options:

### Option A: the Player Plays Both (Recommended)
- the Player controls both characters in combat and roleplay
- Give Spore a voice by suggesting what Spore might be thinking
- Example: *"Spore releases worried gray spores. What do you think Spore is feeling?"*

### Option B: Parent Plays Spore
- You control Spore's actions in combat
- Let the Player roleplay Spore's dialogue if they want
- Keep Spore supportive - follow Lightsword's lead

### Option C: A Friend Plays Spore
- Perfect if the Player has a sibling or friend joining
- Give them Spore's character summary (see Part 2)

### Tips for Two Characters
- In combat, ask: *"What does Lightsword do? Now what about Spore?"*
- Give each character moments to shine
- Spore is the stealth expert; Lightsword is the magic expert
- They're best friends - have them support each other

---

## How Combat Works (Quick Reference)

### Combat Turn Order
1. Everyone rolls **Initiative** (d20 + modifier)
2. Highest goes first, then next highest, etc.
3. On each turn, a character can:
   - **Move** (up to their speed)
   - **Take an Action** (attack, cast spell, etc.)
   - **Take a Bonus Action** (if they have one)

### Making Attacks
1. Roll d20 + attack bonus
2. If result meets or beats target's AC, you hit!
3. Roll damage dice

### Example Combat Round
> "Lightsword, you're up first! The cultist is 30 feet away."
>
> *the Player: "I cast Fire Bolt!"*
>
> "Roll d20 and add 5."
>
> *the Player: "I got 15!"*
>
> "That hits! The cultist's AC is only 12. Roll d10 for fire damage."
>
> *the Player: "8 damage!"*
>
> "Nice! Flames erupt from your claws and strike the cultist! Now what does Spore do?"

---

## Reading the Stat Blocks

Here's how to read the numbers:

```
| AC | HP | Attack Bonus | Damage |
|----|----|--------------|--------|
| 12 | 9  | +3           | 1d6+1  |
```

- **AC 12** = You need to roll 12 or higher (plus your attack bonus) to hit
- **HP 9** = The enemy can take 9 damage before dropping
- **Attack +3** = The enemy adds 3 to their d20 attack roll
- **1d6+1** = Roll a d6 and add 1 for damage

# PART 3: THE ADVENTURE

## Story Summary

**The Hook:** Pip the pseudodragon suddenly becomes frantic and leads Lightsword and Spore deep into unexplored tunnels. Something is calling for help!

**The Quest:** A copper dragon named Emberheart has had one of her eggs stolen by a cult that worships the evil dragon goddess Tiamat. She can't leave her other eggs, so she asks the heroes to rescue the stolen one.

**The Twist:** Most of the cultists were tricked - they thought they were blessing the egg, not corrupting it. Only the leader is truly evil.

**The Climax:** The heroes must stop a dark ritual before the egg is corrupted, then return it to its grateful mother.

---

---

## ACT 1: THE CALL
*~15 minutes*

### Scene: A Peaceful Morning

Start by setting the scene. Read this aloud or paraphrase:

---

> **READ ALOUD:**
>
> "It's a peaceful morning in your underground home. The river gurgles through your bedroom. Fish swim past. Spore is arranging a collection of shiny objects - a copper coin, a pretty crystal - humming and puffing happy pink spores.
>
> Lightsword, you're practicing making small flames dance between your claws. The fire feels natural, like breathing. Pip dozes on your shoulder, warm and peaceful.
>
> It's a perfect morning.
>
> And then Pip goes rigid."

---

**Pause. Let that sink in.**

---

> **READ ALOUD:**
>
> "Pip's eyes snap open - wide and wild. The pseudodragon's tail stiffens. Before you can react, Pip SCREECHES.
>
> Not in pain. In *urgency*.
>
> Pip launches off your shoulder and flies toward the tunnel entrance. Stops. Hovers. Looks back at you with desperate amber eyes. Chirps frantically. Flies a few more feet. Looks back again.
>
> Something is wrong. Something is VERY wrong. And Pip needs you to follow. Right now."

---

### What Does the Player Do?

If the Player wants to know what's happening, explain:
- Through the telepathic link, Lightsword sees flashing images: a nest of glowing eggs... then cold, darkness... a shadow reaching, taking one...
- Emotions flood through: fear, grief, a mother crying
- Pip wants them to follow, down deep into tunnels they've never explored

**If Spore asks:**
*Spore releases curious yellow spores and sends a telepathic thought: "Pip is scared. I've never seen Pip scared. Something about... eggs? Dragon eggs?"*

### Darkstorm Stays Behind

When they're ready to go:

---

> **READ ALOUD:**
>
> "As you prepare to follow Pip into the deep tunnels, Darkstorm whines and paces at the entrance. The wolf's ears flatten. His hackles rise.
>
> Through your bond, you sense his distress. The deep places smell WRONG to him. Like old fire and... something ancient. Something that makes his wolf instincts scream: *Danger. Apex predator territory. Do not enter.*
>
> Darkstorm presses his great head against your side. Then, deliberately, he sits at the tunnel entrance. He will guard your home while you're gone. He will be here when you return."

---

**DM Note:** If the Player really wants Darkstorm to come, explain that the wolf's instincts are smart - a wolf in dragon territory would be in danger. Darkstorm is protecting himself AND guarding the home. This is actually brave!

---

## ACT 2: THE DRAGON'S LAIR
*~20 minutes*

### Scene: Going Deep

---

> **READ ALOUD:**
>
> "Pip leads you down, down, down. Past the familiar glowing fungi. Past the crystal gardens. Into tunnels that grow darker, warmer, stranger.
>
> The walls begin to sparkle with copper ore. The air grows thick and warm. You smell... metal. And something else. Cinnamon? Smoke?
>
> Pip chirps urgently and dives through a narrow crack in the stone. You squeeze through...
>
> And freeze."

---

**Pause dramatically.**

---

> **READ ALOUD:**
>
> "A DRAGON.
>
> She fills the cavern - copper scales gleaming like burnished metal, wings folded against her sides. She's curled around two glowing eggs that pulse with warm light.
>
> But something is wrong. Her scales are dull in patches. Her eyes are red-rimmed. And when she sees you, she doesn't breathe fire.
>
> She speaks.
>
> 'STOP.'
>
> Her voice echoes like thunder, but there's grief in it. Exhaustion.
>
> 'I smell... scales. Dragon-touched. And something small and fungal. Come forward, little sorcerer. Explain why you disturb my grief.'"

---

### Meeting Emberheart

**Who is Emberheart?**
- A young copper dragon (friendly type - copper dragons love jokes and riddles)
- But she's too sad to joke right now
- She can sense Lightsword's dragon blood immediately
- She's NOT going to attack - she needs help!

**How to roleplay her:**
- Speak slowly, with weight
- She's tired and sad, but hopeful when she sees them
- Use phrases like "little cousin" for Lightsword

### What Emberheart Tells Them

When they introduce themselves or ask what's wrong:

---

> **READ ALOUD (Emberheart's Story):**
>
> "I am Emberheart. I have guarded this clutch for three turns of the moon. Three eggs. Three children growing inside.
>
> Four days ago, I left to hunt. Only for an hour. When I returned..."
>
> *Her voice breaks.*
>
> "One egg was gone. Cinderscale. My firstborn. Stolen.
>
> I tracked the thieves to the eastern tunnels. But I cannot follow. If I leave, these two will die without my warmth. A mother cannot save one child by killing the others."
>
> *Her eyes blaze with anger now.*
>
> "The thieves wore purple robes. They bore a symbol: five dragon heads twisted together. They serve the Dragon Queen. Tiamat. They want to CORRUPT my child. Turn it into a servant of evil before it even hatches."

---

### What Emberheart Knows
- **The thieves:** Three robed figures. She burned one as they fled.
- **The symbol:** Five dragon heads = Cult of Tiamat (evil dragon goddess)
- **Location:** She's heard chanting from tunnels to the east
- **Urgency:** The egg could hatch any day. If it hatches during the ritual, the baby will be corrupted!

### The Request

---

> **READ ALOUD:**
>
> "Dragon-blood child."
>
> *Emberheart lowers her massive head until it's level with yours. Her eyes are ancient, sad, and hopeful.*
>
> "Your little friend heard my crying across the stone. I know what you did during the Choosing. You healed a wolf. Freed a pegasus. Saved your friend."
>
> *She knows about the Trials!*
>
> "Will you bring back my Cinderscale? I cannot promise treasure - only a mother's gratitude. And perhaps... a secret about YOUR blood."

---

**If Lightsword agrees:**

---

> **READ ALOUD:**
>
> "Then take this blessing, little cousin."
>
> *Emberheart touches her snout gently to Lightsword's forehead. Warmth floods through you. Your scales tingle. For just a moment, you feel... connected. To her. To all dragons everywhere.*
>
> "Gold and copper share the flame. You will find them. I know you will."

---

**Mechanical Benefit:** Lightsword now has **Dragon Sense** - advantage on Perception checks to find the egg, and can feel its "warmth" when getting close.

---

## ACT 3: TRACKING THE CULT
*~20 minutes*

### Scene: The Eastern Tunnels

---

> **READ ALOUD:**
>
> "The eastern tunnels are different. Colder. Darker. The bioluminescence fades, replaced by patches of strange black moss.
>
> Pip stays close now, no longer flying ahead. Spore moves quietly beside you, ready to manifest those psychic blades at any moment.
>
> Emberheart's blessing pulses in your chest. You can feel... something. Warmth, far ahead. The egg is calling to you."

---

### Encounter: The Pit Trap

As they continue:

---

> **READ ALOUD:**
>
> "The tunnel narrows. Old stone pillars line the walls - this was BUILT long ago by someone.
>
> The floor ahead looks solid, but..."

---

**Spore's Perception Check:** Have the Player roll d20+6
- **14 or higher (Success):** Spore spots hairline cracks around a section of floor. It's a trap!
- **13 or lower (Failure):** They don't notice. If someone walks on it...

**The Trap:**
- 20-foot pit with rusty spikes
- **2d6 piercing damage** if you fall in
- **DC 12 Dexterity save** to catch the edge if triggered

**Ways to Get Past:**
1. **Jump across:** DC 12 Athletics (it's 10 feet wide)
2. **Test with Mage Hand:** Lightsword's spell can trigger it safely
3. **Throw something:** A rock will make the floor collapse
4. **Psychic Blade:** Spore can throw a blade to trigger it from distance
5. **Creative solution:** Whatever the Player thinks of!

**DM Tip:** Let creative solutions work! If the Player thinks of something clever, say yes!

### Finding the Trail

After the pit:

---

> **READ ALOUD:**
>
> "Beyond the pit, you find the first sign that Emberheart's thieves came this way.
>
> A scrap of purple cloth caught on a jagged rock. The fabric is singed - burned by dragon fire.
>
> And there, on the wall: scorch marks. Emberheart DID catch one of them!
>
> A trail of old, dried blood leads further into the darkness."

---

**Survival Check (DC 12):** Following the blood trail reveals a hidden passage behind hanging moss.

### Optional: Fire Beetle Nest

*Skip this if you're running short on time!*

---

> **READ ALOUD:**
>
> "The hidden passage opens into a small cavern filled with a soft red glow. At first you think it's copper ore, but then the glow... MOVES.
>
> Fire beetles. A dozen of them, their bellies glowing bright red as they scuttle across the floor. They haven't noticed you yet."

---

**Options:**
1. **Stealth (DC 12):** Sneak past without disturbing them
2. **Fight:** Easy fight (4 beetles, AC 13, HP 4 each, almost no damage)
3. **Distraction:** Throw something, create an illusion, etc.

**Fire Beetle Stats (if needed):**
| AC | HP | Attack | Damage |
|----|----|--------|--------|
| 13 | 4 | +1 | 1d6-1 |

**Reward:** Fire beetle glands glow for days - free light sources!

### The Cult Entrance

---

> **READ ALOUD:**
>
> "Finally, you find what you're looking for.
>
> A narrow passage carved with symbols. Five-headed dragons. Scales. Flames. The walls are covered in writing praising 'The Dragon Queen' and promising 'the corruption of the pure.'
>
> Ahead, you hear voices. Chanting. And beneath it all... a faint, rhythmic pulse. Like a heartbeat.
>
> The egg."

---

---

## ACT 4: THE CULT HIDEOUT
*~25 minutes*

### Scene: Scouting the Shrine

---

> **READ ALOUD:**
>
> "You creep to the edge of the passage and peer into the shrine beyond.
>
> Purple candles flicker on stone ledges. A crude stone altar stands at the center, and on it - THE EGG. It's wrapped in coils of black thorns that pulse with sickly energy. The shell still glows from within, but dimmer than before.
>
> Four figures kneel around the altar."

---

### Who Are the Cultists?

**Have Spore make a Perception check (+6).** On any success, describe:

"Spore notices something. Three of the figures are:
- A young man, barely older than a teenager, hands TREMBLING as he chants
- A woman who keeps glancing at the exit, with TEARS on her cheeks
- An older man who looks CONFUSED, like he's not sure why he's here

But the fourth figure is different:
- Standing, not kneeling
- Robes darker, symbols more elaborate
- Chanting with genuine FERVOR"

**This is Brother Ashscale - the true believer. The only real villain.**

---

> **READ ALOUD (Ashscale's Chant):**
>
> "Dragon Queen, five-headed mother, accept this gift! Corrupt the pure! Turn golden hope to shadowed hate! Let this child be YOURS!"

---

**Spore's Telepathy to Lightsword:**
*"Something is wrong. Three of them... they're SCARED. The young one is crying. Only the leader believes this. They were tricked!"*

### The Choice

This is the key moment. Ask the Player:

**"What do you want to do? You could:**
1. **Attack** - Rush in and fight them all
2. **Sneak** - Try to get close without being seen
3. **Talk** - Try to convince the scared ones to stop
4. **Target the Leader** - Take out Ashscale first

**There's no wrong answer!** But encourage thinking about those three scared people.

---

### Option A: Combat

If combat starts, use this:

#### Initiative
Everyone rolls d20 + their initiative modifier:
- Lightsword: d20+2
- Spore: d20+5
- Pip: Acts on Lightsword's turn
- Brother Ashscale: d20+2 (assume he gets ~12)
- Cultists: d20+1 (assume they get ~8)

#### Enemy Stats

**BROTHER ASHSCALE (The Leader)**
| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **AC** | 13 |
| **HP** | 44 |
| **Attack** | +4 to hit, 1d8+2 slashing PLUS 2d6 necrotic (13 avg total) |
| **Spells** | Hold Person (DC 12 Wis save - paralyzed!), Spiritual Weapon |

**Ashscale's Battle Plan:**
- **Round 1:** Casts **Hold Person** on Lightsword (Lightsword must roll d20+1 Wisdom save, needs 12+)
- **Round 2:** Attacks with his blade while Spiritual Weapon also attacks
- **Fights to the death** - he's a true believer

**CULTISTS x3 (The Tricked Ones)**
| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **AC** | 12 |
| **HP** | 9 |
| **Attack** | +3 to hit, 1d4+1 slashing + 1 necrotic (4 avg) |

**Cultist Behavior:**
- They're SCARED, not evil!
- **Surrender** at 5 HP or less
- **Surrender** immediately if Ashscale is defeated
- Will NOT hurt the egg
- Names: Marcus (young), Elena (woman), Old Tomas (confused)

**DM Tip:** Make it obvious these three don't want to fight. Have them hesitate, look scared, whisper "I'm sorry" before attacking.

---

### Option B: Stealth Approach

**Spore's Stealth (+7) vs DC 14**

If successful, Spore can get close enough to:
- Observe the scared cultists up close
- Get into position for a surprise attack on Ashscale
- Maybe even touch the egg

If Spore attacks from hiding, they get **Advantage** (roll 2d20, take higher) and automatic Sneak Attack damage!

---

### Option C: Talking First

**Persuasion (DC 15)** to convince the three cultists to stand down.

If successful:

---

> **READ ALOUD:**
>
> "The young man's eyes go wide. 'You... you mean Tiamat is EVIL? But Brother Ashscale said we were blessing the dragon!'
>
> The woman drops her dagger. 'I knew it. I KNEW something was wrong.'
>
> Brother Ashscale's face twists with rage. 'FOOLS! You would believe these intruders over—'
>
> But the three cultists are backing away from him now. They won't fight you."

---

Now it's just Ashscale vs the heroes (much easier fight!).

---

### THE EGG - Time Limit!

**Important:** The ritual is corrupting the egg! You have **3 rounds** after combat starts.

**Describe each round:**
- **Round 1:** The black thorns tighten. The egg's glow dims slightly.
- **Round 2:** The thorns pulse with dark energy. You hear a distressed sound from inside the shell.
- **Round 3:** Cracks appear in the shell - LAST CHANCE!

### How to Save the Egg

**DC 13 Arcana check** to understand: Fire, radiant, or psychic damage will destroy the thorns!

Or just let them figure it out - Lightsword has fire magic, it makes sense to try!

**Saving the Egg:**
- **Fire Bolt** hits automatically (aim at thorns, not egg)
- **Psychic Blade** from Spore works too
- Any fire or radiant spell

---

> **READ ALOUD (When They Save It):**
>
> "The black thorns BURN. They shrivel and fall away as fire strikes true. The egg pulses once, twice - and the warm golden glow returns, brighter than before!
>
> Brother Ashscale screams. 'NO! The Queen's will cannot be denied!'
>
> But it already has been."

---

### Aftermath of Combat

**What happens to Ashscale:**
- If defeated: Unconscious, can be tied up
- If the ritual fails: Falls to his knees, broken
- Either way: Turned over to village elders for judgment

**What happens to the three cultists:**

---

> **READ ALOUD:**
>
> "The three cultists drop their daggers. The young man is sobbing.
>
> 'We didn't know! He told us the ritual would BLESS the dragon! We didn't know Tiamat was evil!'
>
> They look terrified. Of you. Of what they almost did."

---

**Ask the Player:** "What should happen to them? They were tricked. Do they deserve a second chance?"

*This is a good opportunity for the Player to show compassion, but any answer is valid!*

---

## ACT 5: RETURNING THE EGG
*~10 minutes*

### Scene: Going Home

---

> **READ ALOUD:**
>
> "You carry the egg back through the tunnels. It's warm against Lightsword's scales, pulsing gently. A heartbeat, strong and alive.
>
> Spore walks beside you, releasing happy rainbow spores. Pip chirps and loops through the air, doing celebratory barrel rolls.
>
> When you emerge into Emberheart's cavern, the dragon is waiting."

---

### Emberheart's Reaction

---

> **READ ALOUD:**
>
> "Emberheart rises to her full height - and then freezes when she sees what you carry.
>
> 'Cinderscale.'
>
> Her voice breaks. Tears - actual tears - roll down her copper scales.
>
> 'You brought my child home.'
>
> She takes the egg so gently, cradling it against the other two. All three pulse in harmony now. A family, whole again."

---

### The Rewards

---

> **READ ALOUD:**
>
> "Emberheart turns to you, and for the first time, you see a copper dragon SMILE.
>
> 'Dragon-blood child. Mushroom friend. You have done what I could not.'
>
> She looks at both of you with ancient, knowing eyes.
>
> 'Little sorcerer, your gold dragon ancestor gave you fire in your blood. But fire alone is not enough. Today you showed you also have HEART. Compassion. The willingness to help those who cannot help themselves.'
>
> She leans close.
>
> 'When you are ready, return to me. I will teach you what flames alone cannot.'
>
> She reaches into a small pile of treasure and presses something into each of your hands."

---

**Lightsword receives:**
> "A scale from my own hide. Hold it when you need fire, and the fire will answer."

**Mechanical:** A copper scale that lets Lightsword cast **Dragon's Breath** once per day for FREE.

**Spore receives:**
> "For the one who collects shiny things..."

**Mechanical:** A copper coin that never tarnishes - always gleams! Perfect for Spore's collection.

**Both receive:**
- **50 XP each** (progress toward level 4!)
- **Emberheart as a friend** - they can visit her!
- **Story hook:** There's a bigger Tiamat cult out there somewhere...

### Ending the Session

---

> **READ ALOUD:**
>
> "You emerge from the deep tunnels as the bioluminescent fungi begin their evening glow. Home.
>
> Darkstorm bounds toward you, tail wagging, nearly knocking Lightsword over with his greeting. He sniffs you both carefully, satisfied that you're safe.
>
> Your parents are waiting. Spore is already releasing story-telling spores - little images floating in the air showing Emberheart, the cultists, the egg.
>
> It's been a long day. But a good one.
>
> And somewhere far below, a copper dragon curls around three eggs and hums a lullaby.
>
> Because of you."

# PART 5: TROUBLESHOOTING

## Common Situations

### "I want to do something not in the rules"
Say yes if it's creative and makes sense! Ask for a relevant skill check if needed.

### "What's my bonus again?"
All the numbers are on the character sheets in Part 2. For attacks, just remember:
- Lightsword's spells: +5 to hit
- Spore's blades: +5 to hit

### "Did I hit?"
The target's AC is in the enemy stat block. Roll result ≥ AC = hit!

### "How much damage?"
- Lightsword's Fire Bolt: Roll 1d10
- Spore's Psychic Blade: Roll 1d6+3, plus 2d6 if they had advantage or Lightsword was near the target

### "I'm out of spell slots!"
- Lightsword still has Fire Bolt (unlimited uses!)
- Lightsword can convert Sorcery Points to spell slots
- Just use cantrips - they're still powerful

### "Can Spore talk?"
No! Spore communicates through telepathy (mind-to-mind within 30 feet). Describe Spore "sending thoughts" instead of speaking.

### "What does the dragon do?"
Emberheart will NOT fight - she's protecting her other eggs. She's here for story, not combat.

1. What was your favorite part?

2. **Emberheart's Training** - She offered to teach Lightsword more about dragons when he's ready.
3. **Baby Dragon!** - Cinderscale will hatch soon. Maybe they can visit?
4. **The Surface World** - Lightsword and Spore mostly know the underground. What's up there?
