## The Ballad of Lightsword

### "Scales of Starlight" (Tavern Version)
*A Bardic Ballad of Lightsword and the Trials of the Choosing*

**Musical Genre/Style:**
*An underground folk ballad in 6/8 time, meant to be performed on a deep-bodied lute or hurdy-gurdy. The verses are sung in a storytelling cadence - steady and building - while the chorus bursts into triumphant major chords. Myconid percussion (hollow mushroom drums) keep a heartbeat rhythm throughout. Best performed in a cavern for natural reverb, with bioluminescent fungi providing the stage lighting. The melody echoes dwarven mining songs but with an ethereal, magical quality that makes torches flicker and crystals hum.*

---

**VERSE 1**
*In caverns deep a hero woke, no form yet to his name,*
*A glowing child of mystery who'd soon earn endless fame,*
*Said goodbye to little Spore and walked to Temple's gate,*
*Four pillars blazed, four trials called - the Choosing would not wait!*

**VERSE 2**
*Upon the bridge a dire wolf stood, cursed chains upon its paw,*
*Most heroes raise a blade in fear at such a fearsome maw,*
*But Lightsword saw the suffering, the pain behind the rage,*
*He healed the beast with golden light - and Darkstorm turned the page!*

**CHORUS**
*Rise, O Lightsword! Rise through shadow, rise through fear!*
*Darkstorm, Pip, and Starwind - all your companions here!*
*Guide of the Deep Places, scales of starlight shown,*
*A Lizardfolk Sorcerer claims his destiny as his own!*

**VERSE 3**
*Through goblin horde and crystal maze, with wolf now at his side,*
*He saved a dragon, freed a horse with wings spread pure and wide,*
*A flying wolf! A mind-linked Pip! A pegasus of white!*
*Three companions joined his cause to stand against the night!*

**VERSE 4**
*The Shadow Sorcerer took Spore and laughed with bitter hate,*
*But Lightsword came with all his friends and sealed the specter's fate,*
*His glow became his scales at last - green-brown and burning bright,*
*"I am LIGHTSWORD!" rang his voice - a name to turn dark to light!*

**FINAL CHORUS**
*Rise, O Lightsword! Rise through shadow, rise through fear!*
*Magic blazing, allies gathering, legend starts right here!*
*From the depths unto the starlight, Draconic power sung,*
*The Trials of the Choosing done - but adventures just begun!*

---

*— The short version, for when the tavern's closing and the ale's running low*

---

### "Scales of Starlight" (Full Epic Version)
*For festivals, ceremonies, and long winter nights*

---

**VERSE 1**
*In caverns deep where rivers flow through bedrooms carved in stone,*
*A glowing child of mystery awoke to face the unknown,*
*No scales, no form, no certain shape - just light wrapped in a cloak,*
*Said goodbye to little Spore, and to the Temple spoke.*

**CHORUS**
*Rise, O Chosen! Rise through shadow, rise through fear!*
*Magic blazing, allies gathering, destiny draws near!*
*From the depths unto the starlight, scales of power shown,*
*The Guide of the Deep Places claims the path as his own!*

**VERSE 2**
*Four pillars taught him balance - red and green and blue and gold,*
*He struck with warrior's fury and let hunter's aim take hold,*
*But when the arcane crystal blinked and teleported fast,*
*He enchanted his own magic bolt - it caught it at the last!*

**VERSE 3**
*Upon the bridge a dire wolf stood, cursed chains upon its paw,*
*Most would raise a blade in fear at such a fearsome maw,*
*But the Chosen saw the suffering, the pain behind the rage,*
*Smite broke the chains, and healing light turned enemy to sage!*

**CHORUS**
*Rise, O Chosen! Rise through shadow, rise through fear!*
*Magic blazing, allies gathering, destiny draws near!*
*Darkstorm now runs beside him, loyal, fierce, and true,*
*The first companion of the journey - more will follow too!*

**VERSE 4**
*The goblins held the tower high, raining arrows down below,*
*A merchant trapped, a wolf enchanted - given power to FLY, you know!*
*Five illusions of the hero, Quick Shot arrows in the air,*
*The boss retreated, screaming - couldn't find him anywhere!*

**VERSE 5**
*The Maze of Echoes twisted paths with illusions, traps, and swords,*
*But a natural twenty opened eyes to see beyond the wards,*
*And in a hidden alcove small, a dragon hurt and crying,*
*He linked their minds with magic - saw her story, stopped her dying!*

**CHORUS**
*Rise, O Chosen! Rise through shadow, rise through fear!*
*Pip upon his shoulder now, chirping ever near!*
*Darkstorm runs, the dragon flies, but one more waits ahead,*
*A pegasus in shadow chains, nearly drained and dead!*

**VERSE 6**
*The Cursed Grove was dark as death, three shadows circling round,*
*Starwind's wings were gray and limp, chained to cursed ground,*
*He threw FOUR cards at once that day - Turn Undead blazed bright!*
*The shadows screamed and scattered from his holy burning light!*

**VERSE 7**
*The chains resisted - rolled a two! - but heroes don't give in,*
*He pushed and pulled and poured out light to break the grip of sin,*
*NATURAL TWENTY! Chains exploded! Crystal shattered wide!*
*The grove bloomed back to life again - Starwind at his side!*

**CHORUS**
*Rise, O Chosen! Rise through shadow, rise through fear!*
*Flying on the pegasus, the Temple drawing near!*
*But darkness holds the sanctum now, and Spore is trapped within,*
*The Shadow Sorcerer awaits - the final fight begins!*

**VERSE 8**
*"I failed!" the Specter wailed and raged, "I gave my everything!"*
*"Now I'll drain YOUR power, child, and finally be king!"*
*But Turn Undead and Telekinesis struck with furious might,*
*Precise Shot found its mark at last - the shadow lost the fight!*

**VERSE 9**
*The darkness faded, Temple healed, and Spore leaped to his arms,*
*Rainbow spores of joy exploded, safe from all the harms,*
*His glow solidified at last - green scales upon his skin,*
*A LIZARDFOLK SORCERER born - Draconic power within!*

**VERSE 10**
*"What name?" the Elder asked him then, as stars began to glow,*
*He raised his hand, a blade of light, and all the Temple know:*
*"I am LIGHTSWORD!" rang his voice through cavern, stone, and hall,*
*A name of power, hope, and fire - a hero's truest call!*

**FINAL CHORUS**
*Rise, O LIGHTSWORD! Rise through shadow, rise through fear!*
*Darkstorm, Pip, and Starwind - all your companions here!*
*Guide of the Deep Places, magic blazing like the sun,*
*The Trials of the Choosing done - but adventures just begun!*

**OUTRO (spoken, not sung)**
*So if you travel underground, through caverns dark and deep,*
*And hear the name of LIGHTSWORD where the glowing mushrooms creep,*
*With dire wolf and dragon small and pegasus of white,*
*Bow low and know you've met the one who turned the dark to light.*

---

*— As recorded by wandering bards who witnessed Lightsword's Choosing ceremony, now sung in underground taverns from the Myconid Hollows to the Crystal Depths*
