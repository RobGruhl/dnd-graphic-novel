## ACT 1: THE CALL (15 minutes)

### Scene 1: Morning at Home

**Setup:** Peaceful morning in the cave home. Establish that both Lightsword and Spore are present.

📖 **READ ALOUD:**
> "The river gurgles softly through your bedroom. Fish dart beneath the crystal-clear water, their scales catching the light from the bioluminescent crystals overhead.
>
> Spore is arranging their collection of shiny objects on a moss shelf - a copper coin here, a pretty crystal there, humming happily and releasing little puffs of content pink spores.
>
> Lightsword, you're practicing making small flames dance between your clawed fingers. The fire feels natural now, like breathing. Pip dozes on your shoulder, warm and peaceful.
>
> Outside, you can hear Darkstorm padding around the cave entrance, and somewhere in the distance, the sound of your parents preparing breakfast.
>
> It's a perfect morning.
>
> And then Pip goes rigid."

**Pause for effect.**

📖 **READ ALOUD:**
> "The pseudodragon's eyes snap open - wide, wild, frightened. Its tail stiffens like a rod. Before you can react, Pip SCREECHES.
>
> Not in pain. In urgency.
>
> The little dragon launches off your shoulder and flies toward the tunnel entrance. It stops, hovers, looks back at you with desperate amber eyes. It chirps frantically. Flies a few more feet. Looks back again.
>
> Something is wrong. Something is VERY wrong. And Pip needs you to follow."

### What Pip Communicates

Through the telepathic link, Lightsword receives:
- **Images:** A nest of eggs, warm and glowing. Then COLD. DARKNESS. A shadow reaching, taking one.
- **Emotions:** Fear. Grief. A mother crying.
- **Direction:** Down. Deeper than you've ever gone. Follow me.

**Spore's Reaction:**
*Spore releases curious yellow spores and telepathically asks Lightsword:*
> "Pip is scared. I've never seen Pip scared. Something about... eggs? Dragon eggs?"

### Knowledge Checks (Optional)

If Lightsword wants to know more:
- **DC 10 Arcana:** Pseudodragons have weak psychic connections to true dragons. If Pip is sensing something, there might be a dragon nearby.
- **DC 15 History:** There are rumors of dragon lairs in the deepest caverns - places even the oldest myconids don't go.

### Darkstorm Stays Behind

📖 **READ ALOUD:**
> "As you prepare to follow Pip into the deep tunnels, Darkstorm whines and paces at the entrance. The wolf's nose twitches, ears flattening against his skull.
>
> Through your bond, you sense his distress - the deep places smell WRONG to him. Like old fire and... something ancient. Something that makes his wolf instincts scream: *apex predator territory. Stay away.*
>
> Darkstorm presses his great head against your side. Then, deliberately, he sits at the tunnel entrance. He will guard your home while you're gone. He will be here when you return."

**Spore's Response:**
*Spore waddles over and pats Darkstorm's fur, releasing understanding pink spores.*
> "Good boy. We'll be back soon."

**If the Player wants Darkstorm to come:** Explain that Darkstorm's instincts are actually very smart - a wolf in dragon territory would be in serious danger. Darkstorm is protecting himself AND protecting the home.

---

## ACT 2: THE DRAGON'S LAIR (20 minutes)

### Scene 2: The Deep Tunnels

📖 **READ ALOUD:**
> "Pip leads you down, down, down. Past the familiar glowing fungi of your village. Past the crystal gardens where myconids gather. Into tunnels that grow darker, warmer, stranger.
>
> The bioluminescent mushrooms give way to veins of copper ore that gleam in Lightsword's magical light. The walls sparkle with flecks of metal. The air grows thick and warm, and you smell... metal. And something else. Cinnamon? Smoke?
>
> Pip chirps urgently, diving through a narrow crack in the stone. You squeeze through after it, and emerge into a vast cavern.
>
> And freeze."

**Show Image:** Emberheart the Copper Dragon (if available)

📖 **READ ALOUD:**
> "A DRAGON.
>
> She fills the cavern - copper scales gleaming like burnished metal, wings folded against her sides. She's curled around something: two glowing eggs, pulsing with warm light.
>
> But something is wrong. Her scales are dull in patches. Her eyes are red-rimmed. And when she sees you, she doesn't breathe fire. She speaks.
>
> 'STOP.'
>
> Her voice echoes like thunder, but there's grief in it. Exhaustion.
>
> 'I smell... scales. Dragon-touched. And something small and fungal.'
>
> Her great head swings toward you, nostrils flaring.
>
> 'Come forward, little sorcerer. Explain why you disturb my grief.'"

### Emberheart's Introduction

**EMBERHEART - Young Copper Dragon**
- Not hostile, just suspicious and desperately sad
- Copper dragons love humor and riddles, but she's too grieved to joke
- She can sense Lightsword's draconic blood immediately

**Her Initial Questions:**
1. "Why do you smell like gold dragons, little one?" (Lightsword's heritage)
2. "The small winged one - why did it hear my crying when no one else did?" (Pip's connection)
3. "And the mushroom child - why does it look at me with such... curiosity?" (Spore)

### The Story

📖 **READ ALOUD (Emberheart's Tale):**
> "I am Emberheart. I have guarded this clutch for three turns of the moon. Three eggs. Three children growing inside.
>
> Four days ago, I left to hunt. Only for an hour. When I returned..."
>
> Her voice breaks.
>
> "One egg was gone. Cinderscale. My firstborn. Stolen.
>
> I tracked the thieves to the eastern tunnels, but I cannot follow. If I leave, these two will die without my warmth. A mother cannot save one child by killing the others."
>
> Her eyes blaze.
>
> "The thieves wore purple robes. They bore a symbol: five dragon heads, twisted together. They serve the Dragon Queen. Tiamat. They want to... corrupt my child. Turn it into a servant of evil before it even hatches."

### What Emberheart Knows

- **The Thieves:** Three robed figures. She burned one as they fled - their robe was singed.
- **The Symbol:** Five dragon heads = Cult of Tiamat (evil dragon goddess)
- **Location:** She's heard chanting from tunnels to the east, but can't leave her eggs
- **Timeline:** The egg could hatch any day. If it hatches during the ritual...

### The Ask

📖 **READ ALOUD:**
> "Dragon-blood child."
>
> Emberheart's great copper face lowers until it's level with yours. Her eyes are ancient, sad, and hopeful all at once.
>
> "Your little friend heard my crying across the stone. The myconid travels with you willingly. You freed a wolf from shadow-curse and a pegasus from dark chains. I heard the songs."
>
> She knows about the Choosing!
>
> "Will you bring back my Cinderscale? I cannot promise treasure - only a mother's gratitude. And perhaps... a secret about YOUR blood."

**If Lightsword Agrees:**

📖 **READ ALOUD:**
> "Then take this blessing, little cousin."
>
> Emberheart touches her snout gently to Lightsword's forehead. Warmth floods through you. Your scales tingle. For just a moment, you feel... connected. To her. To all dragons.
>
> "Gold and copper share the flame. You will find them. I know you will."

**Mechanical Benefit:** Lightsword gains **Dragon Sense** for this adventure:
- Advantage on Perception checks to track the egg
- Can sense the egg's "warmth" when getting close

---

## ACT 3: TRACKING THE CULT (20 minutes)

### Scene 3: The Eastern Tunnels

📖 **READ ALOUD:**
> "The eastern tunnels are different from the warm paths you know. Colder. Darker. The bioluminescence fades, replaced by patches of strange black moss.
>
> Pip stays close, no longer flying ahead. Spore moves quietly beside you, psychic blades ready to manifest at a moment's notice.
>
> Emberheart's blessing pulses in your chest. You can feel... something. Warmth, far ahead. The egg is calling to you."

### Encounter 1: The Pit Trap

📖 **READ ALOUD:**
> "The tunnel narrows. Old stone pillars line the walls - this was built, long ago, by someone.
>
> The floor ahead looks solid, but..."

**Spore's Perception Check:** DC 14
- **Success:** Spore spots hairline cracks around a 10-foot section of floor. It's a trap!
- **Failure:** The first person to step on it...

**The Trap:**
- 20-foot pit with rusty spikes at the bottom
- 2d6 piercing damage on a fall
- DC 12 Dexterity save to catch the edge

**Alternative Solutions:**
- DC 12 Athletics to jump across (10 feet)
- Lightsword could use Mage Hand to test tiles
- Spore could use Psychic Blade (thrown) to trigger the trap remotely
- Creative solutions welcome!

### Clue Discovery

After the pit trap, they find:

📖 **READ ALOUD:**
> "Beyond the pit, you find the first sign that Emberheart's thieves came this way.
>
> A scrap of purple cloth caught on a jagged stalagmite. The fabric is singed - burned by dragon fire.
>
> And there, on the tunnel wall: scorch marks. Emberheart DID catch one of them.
>
> A trail of old, dried blood leads further into the darkness."

**Survival Check (DC 12):** Following the blood trail reveals a hidden passage behind a curtain of hanging moss.

### Encounter 2: Fire Beetle Nest (Optional)

*Skip this if running short on time.*

📖 **READ ALOUD:**
> "The hidden passage opens into a small cavern filled with a soft, red glow. At first you think it's more copper ore, but then the glow... moves.
>
> Fire beetles. A dozen of them, their abdomens glowing bright red as they scuttle across the floor. They haven't noticed you yet."

**Options:**
1. **Stealth (DC 12):** Sneak past without disturbing them
2. **Combat:** 4 Giant Fire Beetles (very easy fight, CR 0 each)
3. **Distraction:** Throw something shiny, create illusion, etc.

**Reward:** Fire beetle glands can be harvested (glow for 1d6 days, bright light 10 ft)

### The Cult Passage

📖 **READ ALOUD:**
> "Behind the fire beetle cavern, you find what you're looking for.
>
> A narrow passage carved with symbols. Five-headed dragons. Scales. Flames. The walls are covered in writings praising 'The Dragon Queen' and promising 'the corruption of the pure.'
>
> Ahead, you hear voices. Chanting. And somewhere beneath it all... a faint, rhythmic pulse. Like a heartbeat.
>
> The egg."

**Show Image:** The Cult Shrine (if available)

---

## ACT 4: THE CULT HIDEOUT (25 minutes)

### Scene 4: Infiltration

**Setup:** Small cavern converted into a shrine. The heroes need to scout first.

📖 **READ ALOUD:**
> "You creep to the edge of the carved passage and peer into the shrine beyond.
>
> Purple candles flicker on stone ledges. A crude altar stands at the center, and on it - the egg. It's wrapped in coils of black thorns that pulse with sickly energy. The shell still glows from within, but dimmer than before.
>
> Four figures kneel around the altar."

### The Cultists

**What Spore Can See (with Perception +6):**

Three of the figures are:
- A young man, barely older than a teenager, hands trembling as he chants
- A woman who keeps glancing toward the exit, tears on her cheeks
- An older man who looks confused, like he's not sure why he's here

The fourth figure is different:
- Standing, not kneeling
- Robes darker, symbols more elaborate
- Chanting with genuine fervor
- **Brother Ashscale** - the true believer

📖 **READ ALOUD (Ashscale's Chant):**
> "Dragon Queen, five-headed mother, accept this gift! Corrupt the pure! Turn golden hope to shadowed hate! Let this child be YOURS!"

### Stealth Approach

**Spore's Time to Shine!**

DC 14 Stealth to approach undetected. With +7, Spore has a good chance.

**If Successful:**
- Spore can get within striking distance
- Can observe that the three regular cultists look scared/tricked
- Can see the egg's thorns pulsing - the ritual is working

**If Failed:**
- Ashscale spots them: "INTRUDERS! The Dragon Queen warned me! KILL THEM!"

### The Moral Choice

Before combat begins (or during), make it clear:

📖 **READ ALOUD (if Spore observed them):**
> *Spore's telepathy to Lightsword:*
> "Something is wrong. Three of them... they're scared. The young one is crying. The woman keeps looking at the exit. Only the leader believes this."

**Options:**
1. **Talk First:** DC 15 Persuasion to convince the three scared cultists to stand down
2. **Fight:** Combat with all four (but three will surrender quickly)
3. **Target Ashscale:** Take out the leader, the others might flee

### Combat (If It Happens)

**Initiative Order Example:**
1. Lightsword
2. Spore
3. Brother Ashscale
4. Pip (Help action)
5. Cultists (if still fighting)

**Enemy Stats:**

| Enemy | AC | HP | Attack | Notes |
|-------|----|----|--------|-------|
| Brother Ashscale | 13 | 33 | +4 to hit, 2d4+2 | Fanatical, fights to death |
| Cultist x3 | 12 | 9 | +3 to hit, 1d6+1 | Surrender at 5 HP or when Ashscale falls |

**Brother Ashscale's Tactics:**
- Round 1: Casts *Hold Person* on Lightsword (DC 13 Wisdom save)
- Round 2: Attacks whoever is closest with sacred flame + dagger
- Round 3+: Gets desperate, tries to complete the ritual

**The Three Cultists:**
- Will surrender if Ashscale is defeated
- Will surrender if reduced to 5 HP or less
- Will NOT hurt the egg (they were told the ritual was to "bless" it)

### The Egg

**Urgent:** The ritual is corrupting the egg!

📖 **READ ALOUD:**
> "The black thorns tighten around the egg with every word Ashscale speaks. The warm glow inside is fading, replaced by something darker. Colder.
>
> You don't have much time."

**To Save the Egg:**
- DC 13 Arcana to understand: Fire or radiant damage will sever the thorns
- Lightsword's Fire Bolt (or any fire spell) can burn away the corruption
- Spore's Psychic Blade deals psychic damage - could sever the magical connection

**If They Wait Too Long (3+ rounds):**
- The egg cracks
- The baby dragon inside is corrupted (sad ending, but recoverable later)
- Emberheart will be devastated

---

## ACT 5: RESOLUTION (10 minutes)

### Scene 5: Victory!

**If the Egg is Saved:**

📖 **READ ALOUD:**
> "The black thorns BURN. They shrivel and fall away as Lightsword's fire strikes true. The egg pulses once, twice - and the warm golden glow returns, brighter than before.
>
> Brother Ashscale screams in fury. 'NO! The Queen's will cannot be denied! Cannot-'
>
> But it already has been."

**What Happens to Ashscale:**
- If defeated in combat: unconscious, can be tied up
- If the ritual fails: falls to his knees, broken
- Either way: turned over to village elders for judgment

**What Happens to the Three Cultists:**

📖 **READ ALOUD:**
> "The three other cultists drop their daggers. The young man is sobbing. The woman rushes toward you.
>
> 'We didn't know! He told us the ritual would bless the dragon, make it strong! We didn't know Tiamat was... was evil!'
>
> They look terrified. Of you. Of what they almost did."

**the Player's Choice:**
- What should happen to them?
- They were tricked, not evil
- Second chances?

### Returning the Egg

📖 **READ ALOUD:**
> "You carry the egg back through the tunnels. It's warm against Lightsword's scales, pulsing gently. A heartbeat, strong and alive.
>
> Spore walks beside you, releasing happy rainbow spores. Pip chirps and loops through the air, doing celebratory barrel rolls.
>
> When you emerge into Emberheart's cavern, the dragon is waiting. She rises to her full height - and then freezes when she sees what you carry.
>
> 'Cinderscale.'
>
> Her voice breaks. Tears - actual tears - roll down her copper scales.
>
> 'You brought my child home.'"

**Show Image:** The Egg Rescue (if available)

### Emberheart's Gratitude

📖 **READ ALOUD:**
> "Emberheart cradles the egg against the other two. All three pulse in harmony now. A family, whole again.
>
> She turns to you, and for the first time, you see a copper dragon smile.
>
> 'Dragon-blood child. You have done what I could not. You saved my family.'
>
> She looks at both of you with ancient, knowing eyes.
>
> 'Little sorcerer, your gold dragon ancestor gave you fire in your blood. But fire alone is not enough. You have shown that you also have HEART. Compassion. The willingness to help those who cannot help themselves.'
>
> She leans close.
>
> 'One day, when you are ready, return to me. I will teach you what flames alone cannot.'
>
> She reaches into a small pile of coins and treasures - her hoard - and presses something into each of your hands."

### Rewards

**Lightsword receives:**
> "A scale from my own hide. Hold it when you need fire, and the fire will answer."

**Mechanical:** A copper scale that allows casting *Dragon's Breath* once per day without using a spell slot.

**Spore receives:**
> "For the mushroom child who collects shiny things..."

**Mechanical:** A copper coin that never tarnishes, always gleams. Perfect for the collection!

**Both receive:**
- 50 XP each (progress toward level 4!)
- Emberheart as an ally and potential teacher
- Story hook: The Cult of Tiamat is larger than this one cell...

### Returning Home

📖 **READ ALOUD:**
> "You emerge from the deep tunnels as the bioluminescent fungi begin their evening glow. Home.
>
> Darkstorm bounds toward you, tail wagging, nearly knocking Lightsword over with his greeting. He sniffs you both, satisfied that you're safe.
>
> Your parents are waiting. Spore is already releasing story-telling spores - little images floating in the air showing Emberheart, the cultists, the egg.
>
> It's been a long day. But a good one.
>
> Somewhere far below, a copper dragon curls around three eggs and hums a lullaby.
>
> Because of you."
