# DM Prep Podcast: The Trials of the Choosing

*A 10-minute audio guide for running Hendrix's adventure*

---

**HOST:** Welcome to your DM prep session. Tomorrow you're running The Trials of the Choosing for Hendrix. Let's walk through everything you need to know. Grab your coffee, and let's do this.

**HOST:** First, the logistics. You've got ninety minutes on the clock. Set your pomodoro timer for fifteen minute chunks. When it dings, the magic pulls Hendrix forward. Keep things moving.

**HOST:** Equipment check. Blue Yeti microphone, interview mode. USB-A to C adapter. Headphones. Your printed aspect cards. Laptop with the scene images ready to show. And dice. You'll need a d20, d8, d6, and d4.

**HOST:** Now, the most important thing. Hendrix is ten. He's afraid of zombies and undead humans. Skeletons are fine. Evil wizards are fine. The final boss is a Shadow Sorcerer, not a specter. Hooded figure, glowing purple eyes. Creepy but not undead. Keep it heroic and fun, not horror movie scary.

**HOST:** Let's talk structure. Act One is the temple ceremony. Fifteen minutes. Hendrix gets chosen, receives his aspect cards, and does the four pillar tutorial. This is where you teach him the primary plus secondary card mechanic. Each pillar has a twist. The armored dummy wants a warrior card plus something to find the weak point. The target behind illusions wants a hunter card plus detect magic. You get the idea. Let him experiment. Celebrate creativity.

**HOST:** After the tutorial, the Elder sends him into the Whispering Valley. Four trials await.

**HOST:** Trial One. The Dire Wolf on the bridge. Fifteen minutes. Here's the key change from your playtest. The wolf is presented as a threat first. Huge. Snarling. Teeth bared. Blocking the path. You do NOT mention that it's cursed or scared or in pain. That's discovered through action. If Hendrix uses Track or Animal Friendship, he learns the wolf is afraid, not aggressive. Detect Magic reveals the curse on its leg. Divine Guidance whispers that the creature suffers. But if he charges in swinging? That's valid too. The wolf defends itself but doesn't pursue. Strange behavior that might make him curious. If he heals the wolf, it becomes an ally for the rest of the adventure. Name it together.

**HOST:** Trial Two. The Goblin Ambush. Fifteen minutes. This one's good as-is. Merchant pinned down, goblins on a tower, lots of tactical options. Warrior charges in. Hunter picks them off from cover. Arcane creates illusions or blasts from range. Divine protects the merchant. After the fight, Garrett the merchant offers a reward. Note what Hendrix chooses. It reveals his priorities.

**HOST:** Trial Three. The Maze. Twenty minutes. Garrett points to the entrance and says it's the only path forward. The maze has four challenges. Shifting floor tiles. Illusory walls. Flying swords in a trap room. And a riddle door. The answer is a map. Somewhere in the maze, Hendrix hears crying. That's Pip, the injured pseudodragon. Tiny dragon, cat-sized, broken wing. If Hendrix helps it, Pip bonds with him and becomes a companion. Magic resistance, can scout ahead, very cute.

**HOST:** Trial Four. The Pegasus Grove. Fifteen minutes. This one got updated too. When Hendrix arrives, he sees three things clearly. First, the shadows circling the trapped pegasus. Second, the pegasus herself, straining toward him, wings flickering with light. Third, a glowing purple crystal at the base of a dead tree. The shadows seem tethered to it. Three paths, all valid. Fight the shadows directly. Heal the pegasus so she can fight back. Or destroy the crystal to break the curse at its source. Smite and radiant damage wreck the shadows. They're vulnerable. When the pegasus is freed, she's Starwind. She carries Hendrix to the final battle.

**HOST:** The finale. Temple under shadow. Ten to fifteen minutes. The Elder is weakened. Hendrix's beloved NPC from Act One is captured inside. The Shadow Sorcerer awaits in the inner sanctum. Remember, hooded wizard with purple eyes, not an undead ghost. He monologues about being a failed Choosing candidate, bitter and jealous. Combat works. Smite and radiant damage bypass his resistances. But there's also a redemption path. If Hendrix shows compassion, tries to help the specter instead of just destroying it, there's a chance to redeem the spirit. Let it play out based on what Hendrix does.

**HOST:** After victory, the class crystallizes. Count up which aspect cards Hendrix used most. Primary plus secondary. The rubric is in your reference sheet. Warrior plus Divine equals Paladin. Hunter plus Arcane equals Rogue. Balanced across everything equals Bard. The Elder announces the class. Big dramatic moment. Starwind offers to be his mount. Pip chirps on his shoulder. The wolf sits at his feet. He's a hero now.

**HOST:** Quick tips for pacing. When the timer dings, say "The magic pulls you forward. What do you do right now?" Skip detailed dice math. "You hit, the goblin falls." Use the cards as instant actions. One roll per obstacle max. Narrate transitions fast. "You fly over the valley on Starwind and see..." If he's struggling, reduce enemy HP, have an ally appear, or let creative solutions auto-succeed. If he's breezing through, add another enemy or time pressure.

**HOST:** The scene images are in output slash scene panels. Twelve scenes, three variants each. Pick the best one for each moment and show it on your laptop. The aspect cards PDF is already printed, right? Good.

**HOST:** One last thing. After the adventure, ask Hendrix what his favorite part was. Which ally he likes best. What he wants to do next. What his character looks like. These answers feed into the graphic novel you'll create together.

**HOST:** Alright. You're prepped. You've got the timer, the cards, the images, and the story. Tomorrow, Hendrix becomes a hero. Go make it legendary.

**HOST:** Good luck, DM.
