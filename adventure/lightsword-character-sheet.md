## BACKSTORY SUMMARY

Lightsword grew up in an underground cave village among myconids and other subterranean folk. His bedroom had a river running through it, with fish swimming past his bed. His best friend was a small myconid named Spore.

On the Day of Choosing, Lightsword was a glowing, indeterminate figure - his true form not yet revealed. Through the Trials of the Choosing, he demonstrated exceptional magical ability combined with deep compassion:

- **Trial 1:** Healed a cursed dire wolf (Darkstorm) instead of fighting it
- **Trial 2:** Defeated goblins terrorizing a merchant, made Darkstorm fly with magic
- **Trial 3:** Navigated the Maze of Echoes, rescued an injured pseudodragon (Pip) and linked minds with it
- **Trial 4:** Freed the pegasus Starwind from shadow chains with a natural 20

When the Shadow Sorcerer kidnapped Spore, Lightsword stormed the corrupted Temple with all his allies and defeated the ancient spirit.

As the Choosing crystallized, his glowing form solidified into green-brown Lizardfolk scales - his Draconic heritage finally revealed. He declared his name to be **LIGHTSWORD**, and his legend began.

## BACKSTORY

Spore is a young myconid sporemaster from the same underground village where Lightsword grew up. Even among the peaceful fungal folk, Spore was unusually curious - always wandering to the edges of the circle's territory, collecting shiny stones, and pestering travelers for stories of the surface world.

When Lightsword was small, Spore would use rapport spores to share dreams and play telepathic games. As they grew, Spore developed an unusual talent - the ability to manifest shimmering blades of pure psychic energy, shaped from concentrated spore-thoughts. The circle elders called it "Psi-Mycelia" - a rare gift that marked Spore for a special purpose.

On the Day of Choosing, Spore stayed behind, watching Lightsword leave with a puff of proud pink spores. But when the Shadow Sorcerer's darkness swept through the village, Spore was captured and bound to the altar as bait.

Chained in that dark temple, Spore didn't cry or despair. Instead, the little myconid focused inward, sharpening those psychic blades, waiting. When Lightsword burst through the doors with wolf, pseudodragon, and pegasus at their side, Spore was ready to fight beside them.

Now Spore adventures at Lightsword's side - no longer just a peaceful circle-dweller, but a Soulknife who can slip through shadows and strike with blades of pure thought. The violence still taints the meld sometimes, but protecting Lightsword is worth any price.
