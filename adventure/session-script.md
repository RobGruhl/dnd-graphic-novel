**Assistant:** Claude Code (for rulings, descriptions, adaptation)

# ACT 1: THE DAWN OF CHOOSING
*Duration: 15-20 minutes*

---

## Scene 1: Morning at Home

### Read Aloud:

> *The morning sun streams through your window, painting golden stripes across your bed. Today is the day. Today is THE DAY.*
>
> *Outside, you can hear the village coming alive - the clang of the blacksmith's hammer, the call of merchants setting up their stalls, the excited chatter of people heading toward the Temple of Aspects.*
>
> *Today is the Day of Choosing. Today, every young person who has come of age will discover their true path - will they be warriors, hunters, wielders of magic, or touched by the divine? By sunset, you will know who you are meant to become.*
>
> *You sit up in bed and look around your room...*

### Ask the Player:

1. **"What does your room look like? What's one cool thing in it?"**
   - (Let him describe - this becomes part of his character)

2. **"Before you leave for the Temple, there's someone - or something - you absolutely have to say goodbye to. Who is the person or creature you care about most in this village?"**
   - (This becomes the beloved NPC for the climax)
   - If he struggles: "Maybe a parent, a best friend, a pet, a mentor who trained you, a little sibling..."

3. **"What do they say to you before you leave?"**
   - (Note this - it can come back later)

### Transition:

> *You step outside into the bright morning. The path to the Temple of Aspects winds through the village center, where everyone seems to have stopped their work to watch the young candidates walk by. Some wave. Some bow their heads in respect. A few kids younger than you look at you with wide, jealous eyes.*
>
> *The Temple rises ahead - an ancient stone building with four towers, each one a different color: red, green, blue, and gold. The colors of the four Aspects of Power.*

---

## Scene 2: The Temple of Aspects

### Read Aloud:

> *The Temple courtyard is filled with other young people about your age, all looking as nervous and excited as you feel. Guards in gleaming armor stand at attention. Banners of red, green, blue, and gold flutter in the breeze.*
>
> *A hush falls as an elderly figure emerges from the Temple doors. This is the Elder - ageless, wise, dressed in robes that shimmer with all four colors.*

### The Elder Speaks:

> **"Welcome, young ones, to the Day of Choosing."**
>
> *The Elder's voice is like warm thunder - powerful but kind.*
>
> **"For generations beyond counting, our people have come to this Temple on this day. You arrive as children of possibility. You will leave as heroes of destiny."**
>
> *The Elder gestures, and suddenly four glowing orbs appear in the air - one red, one green, one blue, one gold.*
>
> **"The Warrior's Strength. The Hunter's Cunning. The Mage's Mystery. The Divine's Blessing. Today, ALL powers are open to you. You will face trials. You will make choices. And by sunset, your true path will be revealed."**
>
> *The Elder looks directly at YOU.*
>
> **"Come forward, young one. Receive the Aspects."**

### Give the Player the Cards:

> *The Elder hands you a deck of cards - each one glowing faintly with power.*
>
> **"These are the Aspect Cards. Each one represents a different way to face a challenge. In your trials today, you will choose a PRIMARY Aspect - your main approach - and a SECONDARY Aspect - your supporting technique. Choose wisely, and see what feels right."**

**[PHYSICALLY HAND HENDRIX THE ASPECT CARDS]**

Explain briefly:
- "You have four types of cards - red Warrior cards, green Hunter cards, blue Arcane magic cards, and gold Divine prayer cards."
- "Each challenge, you pick your main card and a backup card."
- "There's no wrong answer - we're discovering what kind of hero you are!"

### Tutorial: The Four Pillars

> **"Before you begin your trials, touch each pillar to feel the power within. But remember - sometimes one Aspect alone is not enough. The wise hero combines their strengths."**
>
> *Four stone pillars stand in the courtyard, each glowing with one of the Aspect colors.*

**Red Pillar - Warrior Test:**
> *A training dummy stands before the red pillar. But this is no ordinary dummy - it wears thick plate armor that gleams in the sunlight.*
> **"Strike the armored dummy!"**

- **Primary (obvious):** Any Warrior card - Mighty Blow, Reckless Strike
- **Secondary (bonus):** Arcane Enchant (+2 to hit armor), Divine Bless (+2), or Hunter Track (find the weak point)
- If just Warrior: "Your blow clangs against the armor - solid hit!"
- If combo: "Your [secondary] finds the gap in the armor - devastating strike!"
- **Elder:** "Strength alone works. But strength guided by [other Aspect]? Even better."

**Green Pillar - Hunter Test:**
> *A target appears 30 feet away. But between you and it, shimmering bushes block your view - some look solid, others flicker strangely.*
> **"Hit the target!"**

- **Primary (obvious):** Any Hunter card - Precise Shot, Quick Shot
- **Secondary (bonus):** Arcane Detect Magic (reveals which bushes are illusions), or Track (read the wind)
- If just Hunter: "Your arrow flies true, clipping the edge of the target!"
- If combo: "You see right through the illusions - bullseye!"
- **Elder:** "The hunter's eye is sharp. But the hunter who sees through deception? Sharper still."

**Blue Pillar - Arcane Test:**
> *A crystal hovers above the blue pillar, spinning fast. Every few seconds it blinks and teleports a few inches in a random direction.*
> **"Catch or strike the crystal!"**

- **Primary (obvious):** Any Arcane card - Magic Bolt, Telekinesis
- **Secondary (bonus):** Hunter Track (predict its pattern), Divine Bless (+2 to grab)
- If just Arcane: "Your magic grazes the crystal as it blinks away!"
- If combo: "You anticipate its movement - got it!"
- **Elder:** "Magic is powerful. But magic with patience and precision? Unstoppable."

**Gold Pillar - Divine Test:**
> *A wilted flower sits in a pot by the gold pillar. A tiny shadow creature, no bigger than a mouse, crouches on the pot's rim, draining the flower's life.*
> **"Save the flower!"**

- **Primary (obvious):** Any Divine card - Healing Light on flower, Turn Undead on shadow
- **Secondary (bonus):** Warrior Smite (destroy shadow), then Divine heal, or two Divine cards
- If just Divine: "Your light drives the shadow back, and the flower slowly recovers."
- If combo: "The shadow is banished AND the flower blooms brilliantly!"
- **Elder:** "Compassion heals. But compassion that also protects? That is true divine power."

**After all four pillars:**
> **Elder:** "You begin to understand. Each trial ahead can be faced many ways. Your PRIMARY choice shows your instinct. Your SECONDARY choice shows your wisdom. Now... go discover who you truly are."

### Transition to Trials:

> *The Elder nods approvingly.*
>
> **"You have tasted all four Aspects. Now you must face the true trials. The path leads into the Whispering Valley. Four challenges await you there. Face them with courage, and return to us by sunset."**
>
> *The Temple gates open, revealing a winding path into a misty valley below.*
>
> **"Go now, young hero. Discover who you are meant to be."**

# ACT 2: THE FOUR TRIALS
*Duration: 60-70 minutes (about 15 min each)*

---

## Trial 1: The Beast at the Bridge
*A creature blocks the only path forward*

### Setup:

> *The path through the valley narrows as you approach an old stone bridge spanning a rushing river. The bridge is ancient - moss-covered stones, crumbling edges - but it's the only way across.*
>
> *And standing in the middle of the bridge is a DIRE WOLF.*
>
> *It's HUGE - bigger than any wolf you've ever seen, easily the size of a horse. Silver-gray fur bristles along its back. Its eyes glow with an unnatural purple light as it locks onto you. Hackles raised. Teeth bared - each one as long as your finger.*
>
> *The wolf SNARLS. A deep, rumbling growl that you feel in your chest. It takes a step toward you, then stops. One of its front legs hovers slightly off the ground.*
>
> *It's blocking your path. And it doesn't look friendly.*

**DM Note:** Do NOT mention "curse," "pain," or "scared" in the read-aloud. Let the Player discover what's really going on.

### What the Player Can Do:

**WARRIOR Approach:**
- Mighty Blow / Reckless Strike: Direct combat (wolf has AC 14, 22 HP)
- Battle Cry: DC 12 - wolf hesitates, backs up a step, but holds the bridge
- Shield Wall: Defensive stance if wolf charges
- Grapple: Bold move - wolf is BIG

**HUNTER Approach:**
- Animal Friendship (DC 12): **REVEALS** - "Wait... this isn't aggression. It's fear. The wolf is terrified of something. And that leg..."
- Track: **REVEALS** - "The way it's holding that leg... and those scorch marks on the bridge stones... something magical happened here."
- Sneak (DC 15): Get past without confrontation, but wolf whimpers as you pass

**ARCANE Approach:**
- Detect Magic: **REVEALS** - "Dark energy wraps around the wolf's front leg like a vice. A curse. Someone did this to it."
- Telekinesis: Could nudge it aside (wolf is big, but you could unbalance it)
- Illusion: Create distraction - prey animal to lure wolf off bridge

**DIVINE Approach:**
- Divine Guidance: **REVEALS** - "A voice whispers: 'This creature suffers. It guards the bridge not from malice, but from pain.'"
- Healing Light: Heals the curse immediately - wolf becomes ally
- Turn Undead: Doesn't work - it's cursed, not undead

**If the Player ATTACKS first:**
- Wolf defends itself, fights back
- But if the Player wins a round, wolf doesn't pursue - it limps back, whimpering
- **DM prompt:** "Strange... a predator this size should be chasing you. Instead it just... sits there, licking its wounded leg."

### Resolution Outcomes:

**If he FIGHTS and wins:**
> *The wolf collapses with a final whimper. As it falls, the dark energy around its leg fades, and for just a moment, you see something like gratitude in its eyes before they close. You feel a pang of sadness. Maybe there was another way...*

**If he CALMS or HEALS it:**
> *The purple light around the wolf's leg shatters like glass. The wolf looks at you - really looks at you - and you see intelligence there. Gratitude. It bows its great head, then moves aside to let you pass. As you step onto the bridge, you realize... it's following you. At a respectful distance, but following.*

(If healed, the wolf - name it together? - becomes an ally for the rest of the adventure)

**If he SNEAKS past:**
> *You move as silently as a shadow, pressing against the bridge's low wall. The wolf sniffs the air, confused, but doesn't see you. You make it across. As you glance back, you see it lying down, whimpering at its cursed wound. You could go back... or press on.*

### Transition:

> *The path continues deeper into the valley. Ahead, you hear something troubling - shouting, the clatter of arrows on wood, and cries for help.*

---

## Trial 2: The Goblin Archers
*Enemies at range picking off travelers*

### Setup:

> *The valley opens into a wide clearing. A ruined tower - just crumbling walls now, about 30 feet high - stands at the far side. And from that tower, ARROWS are raining down.*
>
> *A merchant's wagon is pinned in the middle of the clearing. An older man with a gray beard is hiding behind his cart, arrows thudding into the wood inches from his head. Three GOBLIN WARRIORS stand on top of the tower, cackling as they fire. Below, near the tower's base, a fourth goblin and a larger GOBLIN BOSS are creeping toward the merchant with drawn swords.*
>
> *The goblins haven't noticed you yet. You're about 60 feet from the tower, partially hidden by bushes.*
>
> **Merchant:** "HELP! Please, someone help!"

### The Situation:
- 3 goblins on tower (30 ft up, 60 ft away)
- 1 goblin + boss on ground (40 ft away)
- Merchant trapped (35 ft away)
- You're in concealment

### What the Player Can Do:

**WARRIOR Approach:**
- Charge with Shield Wall: Block arrows while closing distance
- Battle Cry: DC 12 morale - ground goblins hesitate, tower goblins look for the threat
- Reckless assault: Get there fast, but take arrow fire

**HUNTER Approach:**
- Precise Shot: Pick off tower goblins one by one (AC 15)
- Quick Shot: Two arrows per turn, less accurate
- Sneak: DC 12 to get behind tower unseen
- Trap: Set up ambush point

**ARCANE Approach:**
- Magic Bolt: 60 ft range - can hit tower goblins!
- Illusion: Create fake reinforcements, dragon roar, fire - goblins might flee
- Telekinesis: Push goblin off tower (DC 13)

**DIVINE Approach:**
- Protection Circle: Create safe zone for merchant to shelter in
- Bless: +2 to attacks for wolf ally (if present) or merchant
- Smite: Close in and smite the ground goblins

**COMBO Solutions:**
- Sneak + Magic Bolt = Surprise attack from hiding, advantage
- Illusion + Battle Cry = Fake army with intimidating roar
- Shield Wall + Precise Shot = Protected ranged assault

### Combat Notes:
- Tower goblins: AC 15, 10 HP each, +4 to hit, 1d6+2 damage
- Ground goblins: Same
- Goblin Boss: AC 17, 21 HP, attacks twice, Redirect Attack (uses minion as shield)

### Resolution:

**When goblins defeated/fled:**

> *The last goblin scrambles away into the underbrush, leaving behind dropped weapons and scattered arrows. The clearing falls quiet except for the merchant's relieved breathing.*
>
> **Merchant:** *climbing out from behind his wagon* "By the gods, you saved me! I'm Garrett, a traveling merchant. I thought I was done for!"

**Garrett's Reward - ASK HENDRIX:**

> **Garrett:** "I must repay you somehow. I have gold... or perhaps something from my wagon would serve you better? I have weapons, provisions, maps... What would you like?"

**Options:**
- Gold: 5 gold pieces
- Weapon: A well-made sword, bow, or staff
- Provisions: Food that restores 1d6 HP when eaten
- Map: Shows a secret shortcut through the maze ahead (+2 to navigation)
- Information: "I've heard rumors of a beautiful winged horse trapped deeper in the valley..."

**Note what he chooses - reveals priorities!**

### Transition:

> *Garrett points toward a dark opening in the valley wall ahead - an archway carved with ancient runes.*
>
> **Garrett:** "The ONLY path forward is through there - the Maze of Echoes. There's no way around it, no way over it. Every Choosing candidate must pass through."
>
> *He leans in closer.*
>
> **Garrett:** "They say the maze tests more than strength. It tests your mind. Your heart. Be careful, young hero - and if you hear crying in there, it might be something that needs your help."
>
> *If wolf is present:* The wolf sniffs at the maze entrance and whines nervously, but follows you in.

---

# THE MAZE AWAITS

## Trial 3: The Enchanted Maze
*A puzzle of illusions and magical traps - and a friend in need*

### Setup:

> *You step through the archway and into another world. The Maze of Echoes stretches before you - walls of shimmering crystal that reflect your image a thousand times. Some reflections look like you. Others... don't quite.*
>
> *The air hums with magic. Colored lights pulse through the crystal walls. And somewhere deeper in the maze, you hear a faint sound - like tiny bells, or maybe... crying?*

### Challenge 1: The Shifting Floor

> *The corridor ahead is paved with glowing tiles - red, green, blue, and gold, matching the Aspect colors. As you watch, some tiles sink into the floor while others rise up. The pattern shifts constantly.*

**Solutions:**
- Track (DC 13): Notice the pattern repeats every 12 seconds
- Detect Magic: Automatically see which tiles are safe (they glow brighter)
- Sneak: Carefully time movements through (DC 14)
- Telekinesis: Float above the tiles
- Reckless charge: Just run! (Take 1d6 damage if failed DEX save DC 12)

### Challenge 2: The Illusion Wall

> *The path splits three ways - left, right, and straight ahead. But something feels wrong. Two of these paths shimmer slightly...*

**Solutions:**
- Detect Magic: Two paths are illusions covering pit traps
- Track/Investigation (DC 14): Notice dust patterns only on one path
- Illusion (turn it against itself): Your illusion interacts strangely with the fake walls, revealing them
- Divine Guidance: "The true path is in the middle"
- Throw something: Object passes through illusion

### Challenge 3: The Sword Room

> *You enter a circular chamber. The moment you step past the threshold, THREE ANIMATED SWORDS rise from pedestals and hover in the air, blades pointed at you!*

**Options:**
- Fight: AC 17, 14 HP each, +4 to hit, 1d8+2 damage
- Sneak (before entering): DC 15 to cross without triggering
- Detect Magic + Telekinesis: The control gem is in the ceiling - smash it (DC 13)
- Shield Wall/Protection Circle: Defensive stance while figuring out puzzle

**Combat tip:** Swords are immune to poison and psychic, but they're mindless - Illusion can confuse them (DC 13 to misdirect)

### Challenge 4: The Riddle Door

> *The maze ends at a massive stone door carved with strange symbols. A hollow voice echoes:*
>
> **"I have cities but no houses. Forests but no trees. Water but no fish. What am I?"**

**Answer: A MAP**

If stuck, Divine Guidance gives a hint: "Think of parchment and ink..."

### Finding the Pseudodragon:

> *Past the riddle door, you hear that sound again - tiny bells, or crying. It's coming from a small alcove hidden behind a cracked crystal column.*
>
> *Curled up in the alcove is a tiny dragon - no bigger than a cat. It's beautiful: reddish-brown scales, iridescent wings folded tight, and a tail with a wicked-looking stinger. But one wing is bent at a wrong angle, and it looks up at you with huge, frightened eyes.*

**To befriend it:**
- Healing Light: Fixes the wing, instant bond
- Animal Friendship: DC 10 (it wants to trust someone)
- Offer food: If he got provisions from Garrett
- Gentle approach: Just be kind - it responds to good intentions

**If befriended:**

> *The tiny dragon makes a sound like purring mixed with bells. It climbs up your arm and perches on your shoulder, nuzzling your cheek with its snout. You sense something strange - almost like you can feel its emotions: gratitude, hope, loyalty.*
>
> *It doesn't speak, but somehow you know: this is Pip. And Pip has chosen you.*

**Pseudodragon abilities:**
- Magic Resistance (advantage on saves vs spells)
- Can scout ahead (small, flies, understands Common)
- Sting attack (poison, but Pip only uses it to help you)

### Transition:

> *The maze opens into daylight. You've made it through. But the valley ahead is dark despite the sun - shadows seem to gather unnaturally around a grove of dead trees. And in the center of that darkness, you see something moving. Something... white.*

---

## Trial 4: The Wounded Guardian
*Three paths to salvation*

### Setup:

> *As you approach the dark grove, you see her. A PEGASUS - a magnificent winged horse with a coat like fresh snow and wings of pure white feathers. She should be beautiful. She IS beautiful. But something is terribly wrong.*
>
> *Dark chains made of shadow wrap around her legs, pinning her in place. Her wings hang limp and gray. THREE SHADOWS circle her like sharks - creatures of pure darkness with reaching, grasping hands, draining her life with every pass.*
>
> *The Pegasus strains toward you, and for a moment her wings flicker with faint light - there's still fight in her.*
>
> *At the base of the largest dead tree, something PULSES with sickly purple light. The shadows seem tethered to it somehow - they circle the Pegasus but never stray far from that glow.*
>
> *The Pegasus lets out a sound that breaks your heart - a plea for help.*

**Three clear paths are visible:**
1. **The Shadows** - immediate threat, circling and draining
2. **The Pegasus** - suffering but still fighting, wings flickering
3. **The Crystal** - pulsing at the tree base, shadows seem connected to it

### The Scene:
- Pegasus: Cursed, can't fly, HP reduced to 15, but can fight back if healed
- 3 Shadows: CR 1/2 each, circling, draining her
- Dark Crystal: VISIBLE at the base of the largest dead tree, pulsing with curse energy

### What the Player Can Do:

**Fight the Shadows:**
- Smite: Radiant damage - shadows are VULNERABLE (double damage!)
- Turn Undead: Forces shadows to flee for 1 minute
- Regular attacks: Work, but shadows resist most damage types
- Magic Bolt: Normal damage, good option

**Help the Pegasus:**
- Healing Light: Partially breaks curse, Pegasus can fight back
- Protection Circle: Pegasus can shelter inside, shadows can't reach her
- Bless: +2 to Pegasus's saves against the curse

**Find the Source:**
- Track (DC 13): Notice shadows always look toward the dead tree
- Detect Magic: The curse radiates from something buried in the roots
- Investigation: Dark crystal glowing with evil energy

**Destroy the Crystal:**
- Attack it: AC 13, shatters on any hit
- Smite it: Extra satisfying
- Telekinesis: Rip it from the ground and throw it
- Mighty Blow: Smash!

### Resolution:

**When shadows defeated and/or crystal destroyed:**

> *The dark crystal shatters into a thousand fading motes of shadow. The chains around the Pegasus dissolve like morning mist. She stands - shaky at first, then stronger. Her wings spread wide, and you see color returning to her feathers, brilliance returning to her eyes.*
>
> *She walks toward you - no, she GLIDES toward you - and bows her great, beautiful head.*

**The Pegasus Speaks (telepathically):**

> *A voice touches your mind - not words exactly, but meaning, warmth, gratitude:*
>
> **~You freed me. You fought the darkness without hesitation. I am Starwind, and I have watched many Choosings from the clouds above. Never have I seen one face the trials with such...~**

*What does Starwind say? Base it on how the Player has played:*

- Mostly Warrior: **"...such courage. You face danger head-on."**
- Mostly Hunter: **"...such cleverness. You find the right path."**
- Mostly Arcane: **"...such curiosity. You seek to understand."**
- Mostly Divine: **"...such compassion. You heal before you harm."**
- Balanced: **"...such balance. You are many things at once."**

> *Starwind kneels before you.*
>
> **~Climb onto my back, young one. I will carry you to your final trial. And... I sense something wrong at the Temple. Someone you love may be in danger.~**

### Transition:

> *You climb onto Starwind's back. Her wings beat once, twice - and you're FLYING. The valley shrinks below you. The wind rushes past. It's incredible.*
>
> *But as the Temple comes into view, your heart goes cold. Darkness surrounds it. The four colored towers are dim. And somewhere inside... is [BELOVED NPC NAME].*

---

# ACT 3: THE FINAL TRIAL
*Duration: 20-25 minutes*

---

## The Temple Under Shadow

### Setup:

> *Starwind lands in the Temple courtyard. It's wrong - all wrong. The banners are torn. The pillars are cracked. And a cold, unnatural mist seeps from the Temple doors.*
>
> *The Elder stumbles out, looking older and weaker than before.*
>
> **Elder:** "Thank the gods you've returned! A dark spirit - it came from the valley. It's taken over the inner sanctum. And it has... it has [BELOVED NPC]!"
>
> **Elder:** "This spirit... it was once a candidate like you. Long ago, they faced the Trials of Choosing. But they failed. They died bitter and angry, and their spirit has lingered, jealous of all who succeed where they did not."
>
> **Elder:** "Only you can face it now. The powers of Choosing are still awakening in you - only you can enter the sanctum."

### The Approach:

> *The Temple doors groan open. Inside, the sacred halls are dark and cold. Shadows cling to the walls like living things. The path to the inner sanctum is blocked by:*

**Obstacle 1 - The Shadow Wolves:**
(If the Player fought and killed the dire wolf earlier)
> *Two ghostly wolves materialize, snarling with hatred. They are echoes of the creature you struck down.*

OR (If the Player helped the dire wolf)
> *The dire wolf (if it followed him) growls at the shadows, and they part. Your companion's presence creates a path.*

**Obstacle 2 - The Goblin Spirits:**
> *Ghostly goblins patrol the hall - echoes of those who fell in the clearing.*

- Sneak past: DC 12 (if he defeated them cleverly, they're less vigilant)
- Illusion: Distract them easily
- Direct confrontation: They're weaker than real goblins (half HP)

**Obstacle 3 - The Maze Echo:**
> *The hallway twists impossibly, looping back on itself - a fragment of the Enchanted Maze.*

- Same solutions as before, but easier (DC 10) because he's done this
- Pseudodragon (if present) knows the way

### The Inner Sanctum:

> *You push through the final doors into the inner sanctum. This is the heart of the Temple - a circular chamber with a domed ceiling painted with stars. In the center, a stone altar.*
>
> *And there, bound to the altar by chains of shadow, is [BELOVED NPC NAME].*
>
> *They look up at you with frightened but hopeful eyes.*
>
> **[NPC]:** "[the Player's character name]! You came!"
>
> *A COLD LAUGH echoes through the chamber.*

### The Specter Revealed:

> *Rising from the shadows behind the altar is the SPECTER. It wears tattered robes that might once have been beautiful. Its face is a hollow mask of the young person it once was. Its eyes burn with jealous, hateful light.*
>
> **Specter:** "So. Another candidate. Another CHOSEN ONE."
>
> *The word drips with bitterness.*
>
> **Specter:** "I was like you once. I came to the Choosing. I faced the trials. I gave EVERYTHING. And do you know what happened?"
>
> *Its form flickers with rage.*
>
> **Specter:** "I FAILED. I wasn't good enough. I wasn't CHOSEN. And I died here, alone, forgotten, while others celebrated their precious destinies."
>
> *It points at you.*
>
> **Specter:** "Now YOU come, with your little cards and your animal friends and your hope. And I'm going to take it all from you. I'm going to drain every drop of that potential, and finally... FINALLY... I will have the power I was denied!"

### The Confrontation:

**Combat Stats:**
- Specter: AC 12, 22 HP
- Life Drain: +4 to hit, 2d6 necrotic, reduces max HP
- Resistant to almost everything EXCEPT radiant damage
- Incorporeal: Can move through objects
- Sunlight Sensitivity: Not relevant indoors

**The Chains:**
- To free [NPC]: Attack the chains (AC 10) or use Healing Light on them

**What Works Well:**
- **Turn Undead:** Forces Specter away from [NPC] for 1 minute
- **Smite:** Full radiant damage, not resisted
- **Healing Light on NPC:** Strengthens them, weakens Specter's hold
- **Protection Circle:** Creates safe zone for NPC once freed
- **Magic Bolt + Enchant:** Enchanted bolt deals extra damage

**The Compassion Option:**
If the Player tries to HELP the Specter instead of just fighting:

> **[If the Player says something like "I'm sorry that happened to you" or "You don't have to be alone"]**
>
> *The Specter falters. Something in your words hits home.*
>
> **Specter:** "Sorry? You're... sorry? No one has ever..."
>
> *Its form flickers between rage and something else. Something broken and sad.*

This opens a path to REDEEM the Specter instead of destroying it. Have the Player make a case for why the Specter should let go of its anger. If it feels genuine:

> *The Specter looks at you for a long moment. Then, slowly, its form begins to glow - not with angry fire, but with soft, golden light.*
>
> **Specter:** "I... I've been so lost. So angry. For so long."
>
> *It looks at its translucent hands.*
>
> **Specter:** "Maybe... maybe it's time to rest. Maybe it's time to let go."
>
> *The shadowy chains around [NPC] dissolve. The Specter begins to fade.*
>
> **Specter:** "Good luck, young hero. Become what I never could. Become... whole."
>
> *And with that, the spirit finally finds peace.*

### Victory:

> *The shadows retreat. Light returns to the Temple. [NPC] is free, rushing to hug you.*
>
> *Your allies gather - the dire wolf (if saved), Pip the pseudodragon (if found), Starwind the Pegasus (always).*
>
> *And the Elder steps forward, eyes shining with pride.*

# ACT 4: THE CHOOSING CRYSTALLIZES
*Duration: 10 minutes*

---

## The Ceremony

### Read Aloud:

> *The Elder leads you back to the courtyard. The sun is setting, painting the sky in brilliant colors. The four towers glow once more - red, green, blue, and gold - and all around the courtyard, villagers have gathered. They watched you leave this morning as a child. They welcome you back as a hero.*
>
> **Elder:** "You have faced the trials. You have made your choices. You have shown who you truly are."
>
> *The Elder gestures, and your Aspect cards begin to glow.*
>
> **Elder:** "Now... let us see what the Choosing reveals."

### Determining the Class:

**Consult your tracking sheet.** Count up Primary + Secondary uses for each category.

**If clearly one category leads:**
> *The cards of [COLOR] blaze brightest. The other cards fade to simple pictures, but these... these pulse with real power.*

**If two categories are close:**
> *Two sets of cards shine equally bright - [COLOR] and [COLOR]. You have walked two paths at once, and your destiny reflects both.*

### Announce the Class:

Use the rubric from the DM Reference sheet. Read this aloud:

> **Elder:** "I see it now. Your path is clear."

**Then, based on the class:**

**PALADIN:**
> **"You have the warrior's strength AND the divine's compassion. You are a PALADIN - a holy warrior who fights for those who cannot fight for themselves. Your sword will be blessed, your shield will protect the innocent, and your conviction will never waver."**

**FIGHTER:**
> **"You have the warrior's heart through and through. You are a FIGHTER - a champion of combat, a master of weapons, a hero who faces every challenge head-on. Where others hesitate, you act. Where others fall, you stand."**
