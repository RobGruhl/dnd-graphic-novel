      "visual": "A MASSIVE DIRE WOLF blocks an ancient stone bridge over a misty gorge. The wolf is HUGE - shoulder height of a grown man. Hackles raised, teeth bared in a vicious snarl, ears pinned back aggressively. Unnatural orange-red glow in its eyes. Muscular body tensed for combat, claws digging into the stone. One front leg is held slightly off the ground - barely noticeable. The bridge is narrow, with crumbling stone railings and moss-covered pillars. Deep gorge below with swirling mist. Threatening atmosphere - this beast means business. No obvious signs this is anything but a dangerous predator blocking the path.",
