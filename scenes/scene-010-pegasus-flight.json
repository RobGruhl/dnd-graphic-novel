STARWIND the magnificent white pegasus soars through a brilliant sunset sky, her massive 20-foot white feathered wings spread wide, coat glowing with restored celestial shimmer. Golden and orange clouds surround them at eye level. Far below, the valley landscape spreads out - the maze visible as a crystalline structure, the ruined tower, the stone bridge over the glinting river, all tiny from this height. Ahead in the distance, the Temple of Aspects with its four colored towers - but something is wrong. Unnatural darkness creeps around the Temple, the tower lights flickering weakly. Exhilarating flight mixed with growing dread. Wind and freedom and approaching danger.",
