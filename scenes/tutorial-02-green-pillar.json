We see what the archer sees. FOREGROUND: The edge of the GREEN PILLAR visible on the right side of frame - forest green marble carved with twisting vines, leaves, and running deer. A leather quiver with three practice arrows rests against it. Soft green light emanates from the pillar. MIDGROUND: THE OBSTACLE - Five bushes grow between us and the target, but something is WRONG. Two bushes are solid, real, with detailed leaves and shadows on the ground. Three bushes SHIMMER AND FLICKER - semi-transparent, edges wavering like heat mirages, no shadows beneath them. ILLUSIONS. They block the obvious shot line, but which ones can an arrow pass through? BACKGROUND: The TARGET hangs from a wooden post - a circular straw target with concentric rings painted red and white, a red bullseye at center. It's partially obscured by the bush maze. LIGHTING: Dappled forest-like light filtering through, green-tinted from the pillar. The real bushes cast dark shadows; the illusions cast none. ATMOSPHERE: A soft breeze stirs the real leaves. The illusions don't move. A puzzle for the observant eye.",
