Three GOBLIN WARRIORS crouch on top of the tower ruins, cackling as they fire arrows down at a colorful merchant wagon pinned in the clearing. Arrows thud into the wagon's wood. Below near the tower base, a GOBLIN BOSS and another goblin creep toward the wagon with drawn scimitars. A grey-bearded merchant (Garrett) cowers behind his wagon wheel, terrified, his draft horse panicking nearby. Scattered trade goods - fabric bolts, crates - lie around the wagon. Bright daylight fills the clearing. Action and chaos captured mid-moment.",
