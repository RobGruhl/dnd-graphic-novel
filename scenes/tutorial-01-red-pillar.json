      "visual": "CINEMATIC LOW-ANGLE HERO SHOT. Camera positioned at ground level, tilted upward 30 degrees, placing the viewer in the position of someone approaching a challenge. FOREGROUND: Cracked stone floor tiles of the temple courtyard, a wooden practice sword lies abandoned to the left. MIDGROUND: A TRAINING DUMMY dominates the frame - but this is no straw scarecrow. It's a articulated wooden mannequin wearing FULL PLATE ARMOR - burnished iron with overlapping plates, a closed-face helmet with a T-shaped visor, gauntlets, greaves. The armor has no gaps, no obvious weak points. The dummy is mounted on a rotating wooden post, arms positioned holding a wooden shield. BACKGROUND: The RED PILLAR rises behind the dummy, a 15-foot column of deep crimson marble veined with gold. Inner fire glows within the stone, casting dramatic red-orange light that makes the armor gleam like blood. Carved into the pillar's base are reliefs of ancient warriors in combat. LIGHTING: Strong directional light from the glowing pillar creates harsh shadows on the armor's contours. Rim lighting on the dummy's silhouette. The rest of the courtyard fades to cooler shadow. ATMOSPHERE: Dust motes drift in the red light beams. This is a test of strength AND cunning.",
