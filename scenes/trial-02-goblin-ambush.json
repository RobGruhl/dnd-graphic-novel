His donkey brays in panic. THREE GOBLINS attack - small green-skinned creatures with pointed ears, wearing scavenged leather armor. One goblin fires a crossbow from a high window in the tower. Another goblin rushes in with a rusty scimitar. A LARGER GOBLIN BOSS in crude chainmail commands from behind cover, pointing and snarling orders. Arrows stick out of the cart. Dramatic action scene with multiple tactical options visible - high ground, cover, flanking opportunities.",
