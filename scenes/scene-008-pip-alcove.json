Curled up in the alcove is PIP, a tiny cat-sized pseudodragon with beautiful reddish-brown scales and iridescent bat-like wings. One wing is bent at a painful wrong angle. Pip looks up with enormous frightened amber eyes full of fear and hope. Around the tiny dragon is a nest of soft moss and fabric scraps, surrounded by a collection of small treasures - shiny stones, a lost coin, a broken crystal shard. Soft reflected light from maze crystals illuminates this secret sanctuary. A creature in need of kindness.",
