In the center, STARWIND the magnificent white pegasus is trapped - shadow chains wrap around her legs, her normally brilliant white wings hang limp and grey, her eyes full of pain. Three SHADOWS circle her like sharks - creatures of pure darkness with vague humanoid shapes, pinpricks of cold white malevolent light for eyes, reaching with grasping shadow hands. At the base of the largest dead tree, a dark crystal pulses with evil purple energy - the source of the curse. Oppressive cold darkness, a noble creature in desperate peril.",
