Goblin warriors excel at causing mischief. Those in service to Maglubiyet have greater discipline and are likely to withdraw to set up ambushes.

Goblins
Goblins are Feywild embodiments of recklessness and ruin. They delight in wreckage—the louder, the more energetic, and the more convoluted, the better. Goblin raids are often as much opportunities to enjoy setting fires and tormenting livestock as they are parts of more disruptive plots.

Goblins obey those who accomplish the wildest plans. Such leaders might be goblin raid masterminds, bombastic magic-users, or those capable of making the loudest noises. Hobgoblins and forceful humanoids might also command ornery groups of goblins, directing their destructiveness toward banditry, sabotage, or war.

The deity Maglubiyet claims to be the god of goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears, and on the Infinite Battlefield of Acheron, the deity commands innumerable goblinoid legions. In ages long past, Maglubiyet witnessed the destructive propensity of goblinoids and relocated a population of them from the Feywild to his realm on the Outer Planes. Since then, hordes of these more martial-minded goblins have flourished, with some finding their ways to Material Plane worlds. These vicious invaders seek to sow ruin in preparation for their god’s conquest.

Multiattack. The goblin makes two attacks, using Scimitar or Shortbow in any combination.

Scimitar. Melee Attack Roll: +4, reach 5 ft. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) Slashing damage, plus 2 (1d4) Slashing damage if the attack roll had Advantage.

Bonus Actions
Nimble Escape. The goblin takes the Disengage or Hide action.

Reactions
Redirect Attack. Trigger: A creature the goblin can see makes an attack roll against it. Response: The goblin chooses a Small or Medium ally within 5 feet of itself. The goblin and that ally swap places, and the ally becomes the target of the attack instead.

Goblin bosses are often the most imaginative, disruptive, or forceful goblins. Through a combination of luck, cowardice, and callousness, these leaders avoid harm at the expense of their followers.

Animated flying swords move as if wielded by unseen warriors. Whether an animated blade is newly forged or a constellation of broken fragments, the object behaves the same. Other weapons from the Player’s Handbook can also be animated and use game statistics similar to those here.

Animated Objects
Magic can manipulate mundane items, compelling them to perform simple tasks. Such animate objects might be unassuming tools or decorations that can defend their creator. These objects follow simple instructions from whatever force or magic-user created them. If left unattended, they might defend an area for ages or repeat a task until they wear out.

Roll on or choose a result from the Animated Object Catalysts table to inspire what sort of magic motivates an ambulatory item.

Animated Object Catalysts
1d10	The Object Was Animated By ...
1	A Celestial or Fiend using the object to protect or torment a mortal.
2	A combination of magic and technology, such as alchemy or alien science.
3	The essence of someone transformed by a supernatural trickster.
4	Fey as part of their games or wiles.
5	Happenstance, with the item gaining a semblance of life after a hundred years of use.
6	A magic-user in need of a guardian or servant
7	The song of a magical instrument.
8	A spirit possessing the object.
9	Wild magic, a spell that went awry, or a chaotic Artifact.
10	The will of a powerful psychic being.

Traits
Magic Resistance. The pseudodragon has Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions
Multiattack. The pseudodragon makes two Bite attacks.

Bite. Melee Attack Roll: +4, reach 5 ft. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) Piercing damage.

Sting. Constitution Saving Throw: DC 12, one creature the pseudodragon can see within 5 feet. Failure: 5 (2d4) Poison damage, and the target has the Poisoned condition for 1 hour. While Poisoned, the target also has the Unconscious condition, which ends early if the target takes damage or a creature within 5 feet of it takes an action to wake it.

Pseudodragons dwell in scenic wildernesses, preferably where life is easy and prey is small and slow. There they behave like contented wyrms, creating tiny lairs amid ancient trees and rugged cliffs. They fill these lairs with shiny rocks, colorful shells, and unattended treasures that catch their attention, and they guard these hoards fiercely.

Pseudodragons grow to the size of large house cats, and most have red-brown scales. Some have scales with other hues or patterns—markings distinct from those of their larger draconic cousins.

Many magic-users attempt to befriend pseudodragons, hoping to enlist them as familiars. The creatures’ intellect and resistance to magic make them excellent companions, and they’re considered status symbols in some spellcasting circles.

Many pseudodragons prefer the finer things in life. These diminutive dragons might be inclined to aid those who ply them with treats. Contrariwise, mages who don’t properly pamper their pseudo dragon familiars might be abandoned without warning. Roll on or choose an option from the Pseudo dragon Treats table to inspire a pseudodragon’s taste in gifts.

Pseudodragon Treats
1d10	The Pseudodragon Wants …
1	Flamboyant accessories it can wear.
2	Mementos from a lost friend or master.
3	Outlandish delicacies—like axe beak-egg omelets or mammoth-milk cheese.
4	The possessions of a sibling, rival, or master.
5	Shiny gifts, from gems to abalone shells.
6	Soft bedding and stuffed toys.
7	A specific cook’s signature dessert.
8	Time-consuming beauty treatments.
9	To hear a bedtime story or favorite song.
10	Trophies and important-sounding titles.

Winged, sapient horses of noble bearing, pegasi are as majestic as they are elusive. Most avoid the affairs of other creatures, preferring to dwell amid idyllic pastures or floating islands, or on other planes of existence. Others serve deities of the Feywild and Upper Planes, aiding heroes in need. In rare cases, pegasi might befriend virtuous people and serve as their companions and steeds.

Pegasi are hunted by servants of evil, leading many of these winged steeds to flee strangers on sight. Roll on or choose a result from the Pegasus Offerings table to inspire how one might show their good intentions to a wary pegasus.

Pegasus Offerings

Shadows are incorporeal Undead that feed on life. They resent the living for possessing the potential and vitality lost to them.

Shadows lurk in dark, lonely places, typically sites that were meaningful to them in life or cursed places with ties to death, sinister magic, or the Shadowfell. Their victims rise as new shadows and prey on the living.

Shadows might resemble the silhouettes of who they were in life or take on more menacing forms. Roll on or choose a result from the Shadow Shapes table to inspire a shadow’s form and haunting.

Specters are bodiless, life-devouring spirits drawn to darkness and negative emotions. Having lost all connection to the beings they once were, these hateful spirits drain mortal essence to steal fleeting tastes of life and warmth.

Specters seek creatures and locations that exude evil and feed on the suffering they inspire. Roll on or choose a result from the Specter Haunts table to inspire where a specter lurks.
