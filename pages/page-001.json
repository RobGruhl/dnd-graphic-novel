NOT a lizard, NOT humanoid with defined features - pure luminous energy in vaguely humanoid shape. No visible face, just two bright points of warm light where eyes would be. The entire body GLOWS and PULSES with inner light, just waking up. Wearing simple cream-colored ceremonial robes that the light shines through. Ethereal, mysterious, magical being of pure radiance."
