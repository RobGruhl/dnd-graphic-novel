        "Lightsword": "A LIZARDFOLK SORCERER with green-brown SCALES covering entire body. Reptilian head with golden-amber eyes with vertical dragon-like pupils. Small horn ridges along the brow. Lean athletic build. Scales shimmer with magical draconic energy. Can manifest a blade of pure golden light from palm. Confident heroic stance.",
        "LightswordGlowing": "A glowing, indeterminate humanoid figure wrapped in soft golden-white light. No defined species yet - ethereal and mysterious. Wearing simple ceremonial robes over the glowing form. Eyes are bright points of warm light. The light pulses gently with emotions.",
        "Spore": "A small mushroom creature about knee-height. Pale cap with bioluminescent spots that glow soft blue. Big, expressive dark eyes. Releases colored spores based on emotion - gray when scared or sad, rainbow when joyful. Lightsword's best friend from the underground village.",
        "Darkstorm": "An enormous wolf the size of a horse, with thick silver-grey fur. Once cursed and in pain, now healed and loyal. Intelligent amber eyes show gratitude and devotion. Follows at respectful distance, ready to protect. Named Darkstorm after being freed from shadow chains.",
        "Pip": "A cat-sized dragon with reddish-brown scales and iridescent bat-like wings. Large expressive eyes full of intelligence and emotion. Found injured in the maze, becomes a loyal companion when shown kindness. Communicates through emotion rather than words.",
        "Starwind": "A magnificent winged horse with a pure white coat and feathered wings spanning 20 feet. Noble and intelligent, with silver hooves and a flowing mane. Freed from shadow chains and eternally grateful, offering to carry the hero.",
        "DireWolfCursed": "An enormous wolf the size of a horse, thick silver-grey fur matted with pain. One front leg is wrapped in crackling dark energy - a visible curse causing agony. Intelligent pack-hunter eyes show fear and pain, not malice. Snarling defensively, blocking the bridge."
