No visible face, just two bright points of warm light where eyes would be. The entire body GLOWS and PULSES with inner light. Wearing simple cream-colored ceremonial robes that the light shines through. Ethereal, mysterious, magical being of pure radiance.",

        "DireWolfCursed": "An enormous wolf the size of a horse, thick silver-grey fur matted with pain. One front leg is wrapped in crackling dark energy - a visible curse causing agony. Intelligent pack-hunter eyes show fear and pain, not malice. Snarling defensively, blocking the bridge.",
        "Shadow": "An incorporeal undead creature of pure darkness, vaguely humanoid silhouette with no distinguishing features except cold pinpricks of malevolent white light for eyes. Sliding along walls and floor, reaching with grasping shadow hands toward the trapped pegasus."
